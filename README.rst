*****
About
*****

Saraswati is a robust, multi-channel audio recording,
transmission and storage system.

The software is based on GStreamer_ and the `GStreamer Python Bindings`_, in
turn using the fine PyGObject_ under the hood. It is designed to run on
`Single-board computer (SBC)`_ systems as well as larger machines.

The system might become the designated work horse for flexible field recording
of audio signals in environmental monitoring systems.

Saraswati is developed by an independent community of scientists from different
domains working collaboratively on this project. You are welcome to join our
efforts.

Etymology
=========

`Saraswati <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati>`_ is the
Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, art, wisdom and learning.

Status
======

The software was tested successfully with Python 3.7-3.9, GStreamer 1.10.4,
1.14.4, 1.16.2 and 1.18.4, on both Linux (Debian 10.x buster, Linux Mint 20.2)
and macOS (Catalina 10.15.7).

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THERE MIGHT BE DRAGONS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.


*****
Setup
*****

This part of the documentation covers the installation of Saraswati.
The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.
Please read this section carefully.


Install prerequisites
=====================

As Saraswati is based on GStreamer_ and, optionally, ALSA_, let's install the
relevant packages.

Debian-based systems
--------------------
::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install --yes libgstreamer1.0 gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
    sudo apt-get install --yes python3 python3-pip python3-gst-1.0 python3-gi python3-tz
    sudo apt-get install --yes alsa-utils mkvtoolnix
    sudo pip3 install saraswati --upgrade

macOS systems
-------------
::

    brew install gstreamer gst-python gst-libav gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good mkvtoolnix


Configure system
================

Synchronize system time with NTP, this is important for appropriate timestamping::

    sudo timedatectl set-ntp true


Install Saraswati
=================

Install ``saraswati`` package from PyPI::

    pip install saraswati

To quickly verify the installation, invoke::

    saraswati record --channel="testdrive source=autoaudiosrc"


*****
Usage
*****

This part of the documentation covers how to run Saraswati.
Please read this section carefully.


Recording audio
===============

``saraswati record`` is an implementation to

- ingest audio from a GStreamer audio source element,
- run it through ``flacenc`` to encode audio with the FLAC lossless audio
  encoder, and
- finally store it using ``splitmuxsink``, a GStreamer component which
  multiplexes incoming streams into multiple time- or size-limited files

Each audio fragment will be timestamped with the current date/time
information in an ISO8601-like format, using a qualified UTC offset of ``+0000``.

In order to learn about the command line syntax, please invoke
``saraswati --help`` or ``saraswati record --help``.

Example output when being started at 03:35 CET::

    recording_channel1_20210620T122642+0000_0000.mka
    recording_channel1_20210620T122652+0000_0001.mka
    recording_channel1_20210620T122702+0000_0002.mka
    recording_channel1_20210620T122712+0000_0003.mka
    recording_channel1_20210620T122722+0000_0004.mka

Display segment metadata information embedded into the file::

    mkvinfo var/spool/recording_channel1_20210620T122642+0000_0065.mka  | grep -E 'Date|duration'
    | + Date: Sun Jun 20 12:26:42 2021 UTC
    |  + Default duration: 00:00:00.104489796 (9.570 frames/fields per second for a video track)


Uploading audio
===============

When the ``--upload=`` option is given, Saraswati will attempt to upload
its spool directory to an rsync target. By default, it will do this each
5 minutes.

Please note ``rsync`` will be invoked using the ``--remove-source-files``
option. So, after successful upload, the spooled files on the local machine
will get purged.

Background
==========

This software gets developed for the "Bee Observer" (BOB) project, a joint
endeavour initiated by the `Cognitive neuroinformatics group at the
University of Bremen`_ and the people of the independent research and
development project `Hiveeyes`_. See also:
